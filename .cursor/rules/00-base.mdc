# Party Game Platform â€“ Ground Rules

## What this project is
- Browser-based party games with real-time multiplayer.
- Stack: Python 3.11, FastAPI, Pydantic v2, asyncio WebSockets, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.
- Now: in-memory state with `asyncio.Lock`. Later: Redis pub/sub + storage backend.

## Non-negotiables
- Use type hints everywhere, prefer dataclasses/pydantic models for payloads.
- Keep endpoints and WebSocket contracts exactly as documented in README unless I say otherwise.
- Never hardcode secrets or API keys. Use `ENV` and `.env.example`.
- Prefer pure-async patterns. No blocking calls in request or WS handlers.

## Dev style
- Small functions; fail-fast validation; return precise HTTP/WS errors (see schemas).
- Log with context: lobby, player, action. No PII or secrets in logs.
- Before writing new code, search for existing utils/models you can reuse.
