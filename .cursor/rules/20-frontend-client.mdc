# Client Rules

## WebSocket State Management
- Reflect server events 1:1. On `buzz_lockout`, disable buttons & show winner. On `buzzer_cleared`, re-enable.
- No client-side timers that affect scoring. Display only.
- Handle connection drops with auto-reconnect logic

## UI Consistency
- Show stable IDs (player name + short hash) in the UI.
- Use consistent styling patterns across all game screens
- Provide clear feedback for all user actions

## Security & Trust
- Never trust clientâ€”server is source of truth; anti-cheat is server-side.
- Validate all user inputs before sending to server
- No sensitive game logic in client code

## Technology Constraints
- Minimal vanilla JS; no frameworks unless requested.
- Use modern ES6+ features but maintain broad browser compatibility
- Keep bundle size minimal for fast loading
